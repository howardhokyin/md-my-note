# Rest

## Problem

- Receiving the data than it needs

# GraphQL

- `Query Language`
- Server-side runtime
- Client can receive `exactly` the data it needs
- Just have `one end-point`

## GraphQL client request

A client sends a GraphQL query or mutation request to the GraphQL Yoga server.

## Schema

- Acts as the `contract` between the `client` and `server` / `frontend` and `backend`
- Define all operation that API can do
- Every single schema must have query

## GraphQL Yoga

## Flow

# Compare with Rest
