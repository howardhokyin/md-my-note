# CI/CD

## What is CI/CD

- Building -> Testing -> Deployment

### CI (Continuous Integration)

- `Automatically` tested and pushed out for delivery and deployment
- `Detects errors sooner`
- Minimizes the possibility of code conflict

### CD (Continuous Delivery) after CI

- Ensures code is packaged with everything it needs to deploy
- Tests in a production-like environment and reduces errors in production

### Continuous Deployment

- Eliminates the need for human intervention
- Sets criteria for code release:
  - If met, deploys into the production environment

## CI/CD Pipelines

- Reduces the risk of error in the deployment process
